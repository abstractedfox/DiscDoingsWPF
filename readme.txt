Welcome to 'Burn Manager 0.1!'
This is a Windows GUI utility for people who want to use blu rays or similar media to store their offline backups. It can efficiently arrange a pool of files to fit across the smallest number of discs possible, keep track of checksums for data integrity verification, and stage the files for you in the Windows temporary burn folder where you can burn them to disc.

This is the first full 'proof of concept' build, which means it isn't very pretty yet, but it fulfills all of these core functions. Future builds will include such luxuries as UX, quality of life enhancements, and more helpful functionality (wouldn't it be nice if it could also scan your local files for bit rot or stage files back to their original locations from your backups if desired?)

For the time being, feel free to bask in the working (hopefully!) core functions. Bug reports, feedback, and suggestions are all welcomed.

What's on the docket for 0.2?
	-Algorithm will be retuned to work faster with smaller files
	-More descriptive information about the number of files in the backup pool
	-More descriptive info in the UI about pending operations (some long-running operations do not give enough progress feedback right now)
